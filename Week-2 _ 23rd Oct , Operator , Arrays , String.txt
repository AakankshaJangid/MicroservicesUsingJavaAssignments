1. List the Operators in Java?
Ans: Operators in java : 
* Assignment
* Bitwise
* Logical
* Arithmetic
* Unary
* Relational


2. Explain about Increment and Decrement operators and give an examples:
Ans: Increment and Decrement are used to increase and decrease value of variable by 1 respectively.
Example : 
Increment : 
int a = 5;
a++ // now value of a is 6
Decrement : 
int a = 8;
a-- // now value of a is 7


3. What are the Conditional Operators in Java?
Ans: There are three conditional operators in java:
* Logical AND (condition1 && condition2)
* Logical OR  (condition1 || condition2)
* Ternary operator  (condition1 ? output1 : output2)


4. What are the types of operators based on the number of operands?
Ans: Unary , binary and ternary operator.


5. What are the conditional Statements and use of conditional statements in Java?
Ans: Conditional Statements and use of conditional statements in Java : 
* If  - execute specific blocks of code when condition true
* Else - execute specific blocks of code when above condition false
* Else-if - execute specific blocks of code when mentioned condition is true and others are false
* Switch - provide various for different conditions














6. What is the syntax of if else statement?
Ans: 
if (condition1) {
    // code to be executed if the condition1 is true
} else if(condition2) {
    // code to be executed if the condition1 is false and condition2 is true
}else{
    // code to be executed if the condition1 is false and condition2 is false
}


7. What are the 3 types of iterative statements in java?
Ans: 3 types of iterative statements are : 
* For loop
* Do-while loop
* While loop


8. What do you mean by an Array?
Ans: An array in Java is a data structure that stores a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type.


9. How to create an Array?
Ans: int[] arr = new int[10]   or int arr[];  arr = new int[10];


10. State the difference between StringBuffer and StringBuilder in Java.
Ans: StringBuffer : thread safe , provide synchronised methods , allow multiple threads to access it.
StringBuilder : not thread safe , faster than stringBuffer , not used in multithread environment.
